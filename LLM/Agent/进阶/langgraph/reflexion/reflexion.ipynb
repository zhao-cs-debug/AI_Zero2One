    "\n",
    "[Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366) by Shinn, et. al., is an architecture designed to learn through verbal feedback and self-reflection. The agent explicitly critiques its responses for tasks to generate a higher quality final response, at the expense of longer execution time.\n",

    "2. External evaluator (task-specific, e.g. code compilation steps)\n",
    "3. Episodic memory that stores the reflections from (1).\n",

    "In their code, the last two components are very task-specific, so in this notebook, you will build the _actor_ in LangGraph.\n",

One recent study by the Rhodium Group found that even if the Biden administration implemented a sweeping package of climate measures \\u2014 including hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy spending that remains stalled in Congress \\u2014 and individual states adopted tougher rules of their own, the United States would barely stay on track to meet its target.\\n In 2014, before the Paris climate agreement, the world was on track to heat up nearly 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, an outcome widely seen as catastrophic.\\n In response, a growing number of world leaders, including President Biden, have said that the world should hold to 1.5 degrees of warming, although some countries like China and India have not embraced the stricter goal.\\n In recent years, more than 50 countries plus the European Union have formally vowed to get to \\u201cnet zero\\u201d emissions, which is essentially a promise to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere altogether by a certain date.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2023/09/19/climate-policies-with-real-world-results\", \"content\": \"\\u201cThey provide invaluable insights on how countries actually design and implement climate policies, and on the hard compromises that doing so can require, such as the rapid expansion of solar power in India, the use of waste to generate affordable energy in Mexico, and the greening of Colombia\\u2019s construction industry.\\u201d\\n The plan also expects for the modal share for bikes to grow from 0.9 percent in 2019 to 11.6 percent by 2050 and estimates that the project could reduce emissions in Lima by 0.64 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) by 2030 and 1.03 tCO2e by 2050. Eight years after the 2015 Paris Agreement set ambitious, achievable goals to curb emissions and adapt to global climatic shifts, the world is still on track for unprecedented climate change -- and bureaucratic, political, and financial hurdles have stymied thousands of climate-friendly policies around the world.\\n How real-world policies can lead to a low-carbon future\\nWebsite:\\u00a0Climate Stories: How Countries and Communities Are Shaping A Sustainable Future\\nWebsite: World Bank - Climate Change\\nBlogs\\nWHAT'S NEW\\nThis site uses cookies to optimize functionality and give you the best possible experience.

The goal of mitigation is to avoid significant human interference with Earth's climate, \\u201cstabilize greenhouse gas levels in a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, ensure that food production is not threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner\\u201d (from the 2014 report on Mitigation of Climate Change from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, page 4).\\n Related Articles\\nFor further reading on NASA\\u2019s work on mitigation and adaptation, take a look at these pages:\\nDiscover More Topics From NASA\\nExplore Earth Science\\nEarth Science in Action\\nEarth Science Data\\nFacts About Earth\\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\\n Climate change is being included into development plans: how to manage the increasingly extreme disasters we are seeing, how to protect coastlines and deal with sea-level rise, how to best manage land and forests, how to deal with and plan for drought, how to develop new crop varieties, and how to protect energy and public infrastructure.\\n Carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping greenhouse gas that is the primary driver of recent global warming, lingers in the atmosphere for many thousands of years, and the planet (especially the ocean) takes a while to respond to warming.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/mitigation-and-adaptation\", \"content\": \"Adaptation is action to help people adjust to the current and future effects of climate change.1\\u00a0These two prongs of climate action work together to protect people from the harms of climate change: one to make future climate change as mild and manageable as possible, and the other to deal with the climate change we fail to prevent.\\n The sooner the world stops the rise of greenhouse gases, and shields people from the warming we have already caused, the less we will ultimately have to spend to stabilize our climate, and the more lives and livelihoods we will save along the way.\\n In Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to sea level rise and saltwater intrusion, the port city of Mongla is investing in embankments, drainage, flood-control gates and water treatment to get ahead of rising waters, and economic development to provide refuge and work opportunities for thousands of people displaced from nearby towns.

Because of the massive uncertainty that surrounds macroeconomic estimates of future climate change impacts, strategies to build the resilience of the economy, especially through appropriate diversification of the economic structure, export composition and tax base, are particularly attractive over the short term.\\n Yet, the global economic ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of climate change are forcing the country to confront new challenges: shocks not only threaten further progress but can reverse hard won successes of the past.\\n And they will also need to provide direct support to the poorest people, who cannot afford to invest in adaptation but are the most vulnerable to experiencing devastating effects of climate change.\\n\"}, {\"url\": \"https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-climate-change-adaptation-and-why-it-crucial\", \"content\": \"Countries agreed to global time-bound targets around specific themes and sectors \\u2013 for example in areas such as water and sanitation, food and agriculture, and poverty eradication and livelihoods \\u2013 as well as under what\\u2019s called the \\u201cadaptation cycle,\\u201d a global framework guiding countries on the steps necessary to plan for and implement adaptation.\\n In addition to developing the policies needed to guide adaptation, governments need to look at large-scale measures such as strengthening or relocating infrastructure from coastal areas affected by sea-level rise, building infrastructure able to withstand more extreme weather conditions, enhancing early warning systems and access to disaster information, developing insurance mechanisms specific to climate-related threats, and creating new protections for wildlife and natural ecosystems.\\n The urgency is especially great for developing countries, which are already feeling the impacts of climate change and are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of factors, including their geographical and climatic conditions, their high dependence on natural resources, and their limited capacity to adapt to a changing climate. Other countries such as Malawi and Pakistan are modernizing the capture and use of climate data and early warning systems, equipping communities, farmers and policy makers with the information they need to protect lives and livelihoods.\\n With every fraction of a degree of warming, the impacts of climate change will become more frequent and more intense \\u2013 and adaptation will become that much harder and more expensive for people and ecosystems.\\n\"}]]\n",
